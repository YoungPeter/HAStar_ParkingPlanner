# HAStar_ParkingPlanner
Parking Path Planning Based On Hybrid A Star

## Abstract
The project implemented parking path planning based on Hybrid A Star. The original version of HA code is from Baidu Apollo.  And the visualization used matplotlibcpp.h. In the next step, I will continue to improve the algorithm for parking scence, including vertical parking slot and parallel parking slot.

## Parking Scence
